# TCo2Emission
The purpose of my database is to analyze and determine the relationship between carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions and the population of different countries. 
By collecting data on CO2 emissions and populations from various countries, the database allows for comparisons and evaluations of similarities or discrepancies
between these two factors. The primary objective is to investigate whether countries with higher CO2 emissions tend to have larger populations or not. 
This analysis can provide insights into the correlation between population size and carbon emissions, helping to identify patterns and trends in global environmental impact. 
By understanding this relationship, we can gain valuable knowledge for developing strategies and policies to address climate change and promote sustainable practices worldwide.
